      <h1>Welcome to Location Logga</h1>
      <div class="section">

        <p>I made this just to play around a bit with cloud computing.</p>
        <p>Also, I just moved and I thought, instead of checking google maps all the time, I'd just automate that</p>
        <p>This project costs me about $20 USD a month to maintain.</p>
        <p>Repo and source code available here: <a href="https://github.com/foreza/location-logga">link</a></p>

        <h2>Tech used:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS, with Materialize (for prettying the view), Chart.js (for basic dashboards)</li>
          <li>PostGres (hosted on GCP) for persisting segment data to DB (yes, it's overkill and was the main cost)</li>
          <li>Google's Distance Matrix API for getting real time location</li>
          <li>Google's Cloud Functions for invoking the distance API, and inserting/retrieving data from PostGres</li>
          <li>Google's Cloud Scheduler for scheduling cloud functions for execution</li>
          <li>Google's Pub/Sub for help/convenience in turning on/off the DB to save on cost</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What did I learn? What would I improve?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Section in progress.</li>
          <li>Pain point - my DB was always turned off. It was super cheap. it took forever to turn on. I'd probably trade up for a more expensive DB if I could ensure turning on/off was under a minute. Sometimes, it would take up to 10-20 minutes to turn on / off.</li>
          <li>And so on... </li>
        </ul>
